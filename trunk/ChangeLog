Changes since b2.1
******************

In addition to these changes, all of the textures and sounds from vanilla quake 3 that WQ3 was dependant on, have been replaced.  So some things in the game will look or sound different.  This is in preparation for a standalone release, to be announced at a later date.

*** NEW ***
- The delagging code is upgraded to Unlagged 2.01, giving several benefits.
	- more reliable hitscan delagging
	- better player movement smoothing
	- new client cvars: cg_delag, cg_projectileNudge, cg_optimizePrediction, cg_cmdTimeNudge, cl_timeNudge
	- new server cvars: g_delagHitscan, g_truePing, g_unlaggedVersion
	- should lessen the client cpu load (set cg_optimizePrediction 1)
- Ammo counts displayed in weapons choose menu.
- Ability to select either one of two pistols of the same kind.
- You can now go into spectator mode and then rejoin, without losing your score.
- Refresh rate can now be set in the System menu.
- Added a menu option for disabling or changing the talk sound.

*** CHANGES ***
- Deathcam now turns to follow your killer, and is hopefully less buggy.
- Try to find spawnpoints at least 700 units away from enemy players.
- Players don't drop the ammo belt when they die, because people don't like to pick up an empty belt.
- The ammo belt will no longer enable the player to carry more of knives, molotovs, or dynamite.
- Capped movement speed at 75% while reloading, to allow players to knife you more easily.
- Made altfire for pistols about 12% faster, but increase spread multiplier from 1.6 to 3.
- When doing a refresh, the ingame browser now checks only wq3 servers, should be a lot faster.
- If dropping a pistol in akimbo mode, switch to the remaining pistol instead of highest ranked weapon.
- FFA is now default gametype for wq_- maps in the 'Join' menu.
- Made the server info popup in the Join menu larger.
- Made it possible to disengage scoped mode while reloading the Sharps.
- Drop knives, molotovs, and dynamite with the correct amount of ammo, instead of always just one.
- Easier to move silently down stairs.
- Tweaked weapon pricing.  Dynamite, molotov, and knives 50% cheaper.  Winchester '97 two dollars cheaper.
- Can now replace both pistols with lesser ones without dropping the old ones.  If you have two Peacemakers, buying two Schofields to replace them will work without having to drop the last Peacemaker.
- If you have two pistols of the same kind and press the dropweapon key, the one with the least ammo left will be dropped, instead of always the one in your left hand.
