Changes since b2.1
******************

In addition to these changes, all of the textures and sounds from vanilla quake 3 that WQ3 was dependant on, have been replaced.  So some things in the game will look or sound different.  This is in preparation for a standalone release, to be announced at a later date.

	- more reliable hitscan delagging
	- better player movement smoothing
	- new client cvars: cg_delag, cg_projectileNudge, cg_optimizePrediction, cg_cmdTimeNudge, cl_timeNudge
	- new server cvars: g_delagHitscan, g_truePing, g_unlaggedVersion
	- should lessen the client cpu load (set cg_optimizePrediction 1)
- Ammo counts displayed in weapons choose menu.
- Ability to select either one of two pistols of the same kind.

- Made altfire for pistols about 12% faster, but increase spread multiplier from 1.6 to 3.
- When doing a refresh, the ingame browser now checks only wq3 servers, should be a lot faster.
